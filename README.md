# Student Performance
This analysis processes the [Student Performance dataset](10.24432/C5TG7T), which describes students in Portuguese secondary schools. The dataset contains a total of 649 students described by 33 attributes.

The use of the dataset may vary. It is possible to predict final grade, midterm grades, or even students' alcohol consumption. My analysis deals with the prediction of whether or not a student will meet the minimum threshold of success in Portuguese subject.

The aim of this analysis is to revisit my knowledge of ML analysis and try to work with new methods.

## Current progress:
- Understanding the data
- Data preprocessing
- Modelling with Decision Trees
- Modelling with Random Forests
- Modelling with Gradient Boosting
- Modelling with SVC (Support Vector Classification)
- Modelling with Neural Networks
